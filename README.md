# Openframe VLC extension

This extension adds VLC support to Openframe. It uses the VLC that is pre-installed on Raspian. 

It supports [a lot of formats](https://wiki.videolan.org/VLC_Features_Formats/). For example:
- most video files
- most image files: Beware, there are a few known problems with images. Read further below.
- most audio files
- Youtube / Vimeo URLs
- just try it probably works!

It also supports streaming. Large videos play straight away and don't need to be downloaded first.

# Installation

First, follow the [Openframe Getting started guide](https://docs.openframe.io/#getting-started).

Then, run the following command: `openframe -i openframe-vlc`

# How to upload artwork (or whatever you like to display)?

Follow the [adding artwork section](https://docs.openframe.io/#adding-artwork) of the Openframe docs and use `openframe-vlc` as artwork format.

# Known problems

- Animated GIFs are unsupported yet: https://trac.videolan.org/vlc/ticket/6697
- If Openframe is started via SSH, images are displayed on the terminal instead of the main display. Videos are okay in all cases. Images are okay if Openframe is started on directly the machine running Openframe.
- Images don't keep their aspect ratio but are stretched to the entire screen.
  - Might be related to: https://trac.videolan.org/vlc/ticket/22128 and https://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=148898&p=490613&hilit=raspberry+pi+image#p490613. The issue only appeard on a specific Raspberry Pi version. They fixed it by getting another version of the Pi. According to the thread it works fine on a Pi 3B+. I was testing with a Pi 3B.
  - I've done some tests with `--croppadd-crop` and `--croppadd-padd` options. Might be possible to work around it using that.
